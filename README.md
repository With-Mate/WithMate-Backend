# 📢 Introduction 
Due to various ostentatious social media and competitive culture in modern society, modern people feel anxiety, coercion, and relative deprivation. This is especially true in Korea, the home country of our team. There are many goal management and study planner apps on the market, where the adverse effects of modern competition and comparative culture are maximized. For example, one of the study time measurement apps in Korea is full of people who record nearly 20 hours of study time out of 24 hours. It makes users feel flogged and intimidated that they can't study for 20 hours. Of course, as everyone knows, not being lazy just because you don't study for 20 hours out of 24 hours.
<br/><br/>
That's where we started WithMate. 
<br/>
Modern society tends to focus only on how much time is spent achieving goals and whether goals are successful or unsuccessful. Also, many goal management services have a culture of competition and comparison that is excessively formed, making modern people suffer. By recognizing and solving these problems, we tried to make modern people set and achieve goals at a healthy and sustainable level, and in the process, we wanted to pay attention to growth and learning rather than success and failure of goals.
<br/><br/>
 WithMate is a 'journey record' site that allows you to focus on
what you feel and learn in the 'process' of progressing your goals.
It differs from the goal management app on the market, which
focuses on whether or not the goal is successful, and how much
time the goal has been done for a long time.
<br/><br/>
These are the two values of our service.
<br/>
Number one: Finding your own pace without comparing it to others.
<br/>
Number two: emphasizing the value of the journey(process), not success and failure, which is contrary to the dichotomous thinking that focuses only on the outcome. <br/>
WithMate supports your journey towards achieving goals and creates
valuable records with your mate.
Share the value of the journey, convey positive inspiration,
and WithMate will make your journey more meaningful.
<br/><br/>
Record and share your journey together with WithMate!
